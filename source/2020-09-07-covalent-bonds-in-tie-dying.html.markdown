Use soda ash (sodium sodium carbonate Na2CO3) to "fix" colour. The fix is a covalent bond between the cellulose and the dye. Research covalent bonds: here are some resources.

Everything we do, from digesting our food to making art, involves chemistry. Everything is made of chemicals.

Some dyes, such as the kind you can buy in the grocery store here in the US, really just stain clothes, so the dye washes out a little every time you wash it. A really good dye actually chemically attaches to the molecules of the fabric and can never be washed out.

A molecule is much too tiny to see, but we can use models to show what the dye molecule is shaped like. Each of these balls represents a different sort of atom. These Cs are carbon atoms, like you see in charcoal. The Os are oxygen, like in the air you breathe, and these Cls are chlorine, like in bleach. This model shows you what the blue molecules in this bottle are shaped like.

Different dye colors are made of different dye molecules.
Each different shape of dye molecule absorbs light differently. That's what makes the different colors!

The fabric your clothing is made out of is also made of molecules. Cotton, which grows on a cotton plant, is made of long strands of cellulose molecules, all twisted together. Cellulose is the same thing that wood is made of. Here is a model of a cellulose molecule:

If you put these two molecules, the dye and the cotton, together, nothing will happen, unless you can get some of the atoms on the surfaces to come unstuck. If the H comes off of the cellulose, and the Cl comes off of one end of the dye molecule, the molecules will be able to react with each other and stick together.

How do we get the H and the Cl to get off of the cellulose and the dye? We  add another chemical, called sodium carbonate:

What this does is increase the pH. That's how we say that it makes it less acid. You already know about some acids - vinegar and lemon juice are sour because they are acids. An acid has a low pH. The opposite of acid is called a base. You've probably seen a base in your kitchen, called baking soda. When you put baking soda in water, you get a high pH. You can taste the baking soda in your kitchen, but don't taste these chemicals! A high pH is all that is needed to get the dye and the cellulose ready to react. Sodium carbonate is stronger than baking soda, so it works better for dyeing.

All we have to do to make a permanent bond between the dye and the cotton is to put the dye on the cotton and add washing soda. We can put the sodium carbonate on the fabric before or after we put on the dye. After we put the dye and the sodium carbonate on the fabric, we just have to wait a while. While we wait, the reaction is happening - chlorines are coming off the of the dye molecules and hydrogens are coming off of the cellulose molecules. If they do this right next to each other, the dye then attaches to the cellulose, and a permanant bond is formed. If we leave it in a warm room for a few hours, we can then wash the excess dye out. We have to rinse it in cold water and wash it with detergent in hot water to get all the extra dye off. After all the excess dye is out, the dye left on the fabric is permanant and looks like this.
