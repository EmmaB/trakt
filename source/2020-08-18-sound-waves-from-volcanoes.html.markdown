Watch this video of a volcano exploding. Notice the sound wave that travels towards the boat. Knowing the speed of sound, and counting the number of seconds from the explosion to the boat, how far away is the boat from the volcano?

Speed of sound (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound)):
The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. At 20 °C (68 °F), the speed of sound in air is about 343 metres per second (1,235 km/h; 1,125 ft/s; 767 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in 2.9 s or a mile in 4.7 s. It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagating.

### Answer:

We used the triangle of d over s times t to remember that distance equals speed times time.

d = ?

s = 343 m/s

t = 15 seconds

d = s x t which we did:

d = 343 x 15 = 5145m = rounded, 5km

### Parent's comments:

Excellent use of the d = s x t that we saw in the physics book!
