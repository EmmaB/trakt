Well, who'd a thunk? It turns out that Raspberry the cat is a German-language speaker. No wonder he has no idea what we're talking about most of the time. See if you can have a conversation with him in the language he understands, and make some notes on how it goes.

### Answer:

He said: Wie geht's?
I said: Mir geht's gut!

Which means "I'm fine", or "I'm good".

He definitely perked up!

### Parent's comments:

After the conversation we were so jolly that we did a Duolingo together: second one of the day!
