Let's go stream dipping at Pooh Sticks bridge, and count how many little creatures there are in 100ml of stream water. We'll do the same in autumn, then winter. What do you think the result will be? Write up the experiment in the scientific way, with a hypothesis and a clear method so we can follow the instructions again in a few months.

### Answer:

Hypothesis: There are living creatures in the water.

Method: The glass was lowered into the water, carrying rocks to remove buoyancy. The water was examined by eye. The amount of water captured was 230ml.

Results: Nothing was found in the water except for some non-sentient dust.

Conclusion: There isn't enough information to form a conclusion. We will have to do more experiments with more hypotheses.

### Parent's comments:

We also looked at the waves that spread out in the water, and compared them to the waves of sound from the volcano this morning.
