Write a story where you set the scene.

### Answer:

Prologue

Imagine if you had found your way into another dimension by building a portal and hopping straight in, would you decide to live there and "set up camp". Personally I would take notes and run back through, but that is not what the ancient builders thought. They made it their primary settlement. They brought over everything from their home dimension, and in fact hardly even went back to the overworld! But most would say they stayed too long. They set up entire fortresses and farms, however this second dimension was too much for any sort of plant nutrition. And so eventually they took so long they had to work with what they had. They could still of course bring supplies over from the overworld. But most of the time  they had to work with what they found in this second dimension. The dimension in question was named the "Nether".

The wheat and carrots of the overworld were replaced by the Netherwart fungus of the Soulsand. But sometimes they took too long: many of these ancient builders died in this forsaken hellscape. And in this second dimension when the bodies of the dead are left prone, discarded and left to rot, their souls are dragged down to the ground to form the very ground itself. And all that is left is a skeleton, a black, withered skeleton. These were named by the ancient builders, the "Wither Skeletons".


And then, one night, they came up with the genius idea of bringing their friends back to life. Surely they were able to reverse the side effects. They had the soul and they had the skeleton: why would it not work? So they tested it, but it didn't work.

But it must work! So they must have done something wrong. So they didn't give up. They tried again, day after day after day, experimenting with differnt shapes of how to resurrect the dead. But then they made something, but it wasn't what they wanted. They created such a terrible monster that nobody was prepared to fight back and nobody was able to. They had no choice but to flee back to the Overworld. They destroyed their portals so there was no way the monster could escape. But they weren't quick enough. It escaped through the portal and then destroyed the portal. Every portal they had ever designed in this world was partially destroyed. They had no place to go. They were all destroyed by this monster before they could get to them. But there was one place this monster could not venture. There would be a big risk, but they would have to take it. And they did.



### Parent's comments:

"forsaken hellscape": "we're describing it by its appearance despite it having a name, because we're showing not telling."

Edited the phrase "many of these": he said he "joined the sentences together to explain the "they" pronoun".

"We need to make it a pageturner, so the sentences need to make peope want to carry on reading."

Brief aside to calculate the amount of gold that Steve the as-yet unnamed protagonist can carry which is 247040 tonnes, based on a google search for the weight of gold per tonne.

This is a first draft: lots of scope for coming back to edit it.
