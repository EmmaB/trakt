Intro:
Minecraft is an offline and online video game that is all about adventuring and exploring a now world made out entirely of cubes. It's been over 10 years since Minecraft was conceived, and in that time it has risen to heights that no other video game has.  With 176M copies sold across all its platforms and a thriving community, it really is one of a kind.  But what most people don't know is the story of how it came to be. What has changed about it? How much has changed? And was it worth it?   In this essay, I'll be taking a deep dive into Minecraft's history, and about how this game changed video games forever and how it rose to the top.


Main body:
Minecraft began as a small single player game in randomly generated worlds you were able to build houses and explore, but there wasn’t much else to it, there was also a multiplayer option, these were also randomly generated worlds and they connected players together in a single one of these worlds through Local Area Network (LAN). There was no purpose for the player in Minecraft, and that may sound bad at first, but most people back in 2009, loved it! They loved just leaping around an island in the middle of nowhere without a care in the world, people with this opportunity got to build entire cities on these islands and then show it to their friends, without any time limit or battle to remember you have to take care of, the only limit was your imagination, well, and space.
Point: Minecraft has seen many changes.
Example: For example… the number and variety of MPCs has increased.
Explain: The number and variety of MPCs shows that Minecraft is always changing and being actively developed.
Develop: The sheer variety of MPCs makes for a more thrilling and interesting game, and a greater level of challenge to its player community.
