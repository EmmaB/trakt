Go outside and follow the instructions for making ink. Make two batches, and add salt to one of them. Salt is a preservative. Write up your experiment in the scientific style "Hypothesis > Prediction > Method > Results > Conclusion".

### Answer

#### Hypothesis:

Fruit based ink goes moldy without a preservative.

#### Prediction:

The ink with the preservative will be as we left it but without won't.

#### Method:

The blackcurrants  were sieved for 5 minutes each and placed into jam jars. One was given salt afterwards and the other was not. The lids were left off and kept inside to minimise results.

#### Results:

* Day 1: No mould.
* Day 10: No mould, just dried out

#### Conclusion:

I don't know whether preservatives work because both jars were not mouldy.

### Parent's comments:

Good chance to talk about the vaguaries of science experiments, and how important it is to write up your notes so that other scientists can replicate your experiment.
