Go to the church and look for the WW1 War Memorial. Currently, no one knows about it as the records are blank.

Take a photo, make notes, and send it on an <a href="https://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/50272">email to the central register</a> to update the War Memorials database. They say "At present no image of this war memorial is available for online display. If you have a photograph of this war memorial, please send it to memorials@iwm.org.uk for inclusion on the Register. The image will be credited to yourself and free for reuse for non-commercial purposes by others under the IWM Non Commercial Licence."
